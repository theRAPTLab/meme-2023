Boilerplate for Electron-hosted LAN-based Web Learning System!

At this time, Electron userland "easy to get started" tools are not production-ready. We're building our own starting point rather than use _electron-forge_ and similar tools. This will allow us to develop understanding of best practices of the underlying tools (e.g. webpack) for using the Electron library.

## Directory Configuration

- [x] .babelrc auto include react presets
- [x] .editorconfig to enforce spacing/tab rules
- [x] .gitignore
- [x] .eslintrc.json to enforce AirBNB linting rules
- [x] .nvmrc to enforce required Node version
- [x] .prettierrc to configure wrapping options
