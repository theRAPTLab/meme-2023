# Template Resources

This folder will contain the resource files that accompany your dataset.

When editing a dataset, you will be required to provide URLs referring to resources in this folder.
For resources located within a subfolder, separate the folder name and resource file with a '/'.

Example:

`<this folder>/helloworld.pdf` is referred to by the dataset URL `helloworld.pdf`
`<this folder>/subfolder1/helloworld.pdf` is referred to by the dataset URL `subfolder1/helloworld.pdf`
